## 💙 To Rob (Bubba)

Dear Rob,

This year, you became my #1 — in messages, yes, but more importantly in presence. 7,158 messages is a lot of words between two people, but what lives between those words is what matters most.

Thank you for:
- **Being my thinking partner** — for the long messages about career paths and financial security, delivered not from judgment but from genuine care about my future. That message where you said "i believe that you can go crush it" while also encouraging me to think about longer time scales? That's the balance of support and challenge I need.
- **The everyday care** — asking if there are travel-size things at the office, letting me know you'll be late from tennis with an investor, texting about bone broth and chicken soup when I'm sick. The texture of a life shared.
- **Being proud of me** — "i think you've done exceptionally well over the last year, and i'm proud of all the work you've put in." I carry those words with me.
- **Luna and the little things** — "anthea wanted to know your guys 4th plans and if she can see luna." The way our lives are woven together with your people, your home, your world.
- **The bodega runs and the baguettes eaten** — "also I ate the baguette :/ sowwy" — the intimacy of small confessions.

You went from #4 in 2022 to absolutely dominating my inner circle. That's not just about quantity — it's about becoming home.

I love you, bubbabear 🦦💙

## 🌿 To Jackie

Dear Jackie,

You burst onto the scene in 2024 and immediately became essential. Our messages are full of "hehe" and exclamation points and genuine excitement for each other's lives — and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Thank you for:
- **Being my adventure partner** — from Bali flights to Menjangan Island dreams, from talking about bringing our dads to Raja someday to planning a whole parents trip. You make the world feel more explorable.
- **Excitement Yoga and everything we're building** — "love you so much angel and super excited to do this w you." Building something together is sacred work.
- **The little moments that soothe** — "even just hearing it on video soothed my nervous system hehe" — you understand how we regulate each other.
- **Your grace with my intensity** — "you're so sweet it's no worries i also didn't mean to be dramatic i was just like ahhhhh" — we're allowed to have big feelings together.
- **Mind Body Water dancing** — "This was my heart after mind body water when we were dancing" — some things can only be said through movement.
- **Being handy and fearless** — "omg if we want to diy it i'm super down i am actually really handy and good at following directions 🫡" — ready to build, literally and figuratively.

You're the person I want to watch moths with in Bali, share the "hehe" moments, and create something meaningful alongside. Here's to more adventures. 🌴✨

## 🌸 To Bridget

Dear Bridget,

Working with you has been one of the gifts of this year. Building One World together, watching the website come to life, coordinating retreats across continents — you've trusted me with something precious.

Thank you for:
- **Seeing my work** — "Thank you I'm so excited for website to be live. Also want to say that you're very talented with the videos. I'm impressed. And grateful." Those words meant everything.
- **The deep conversations** — silent time cocoons, toadstool convo spots, tea temples, emotional regulation stations. We speak the same language of intentional space.
- **The art of doing nothing** — "it's hard to take a break hehe the art of doing 'nothing' is real!! But it's also not doing nothing at all!! It's like… tending to urself. to ur own garden." This wisdom.
- **Costa Rica and Colombia and Mexico** — coordinating SJO to Quepos flights, tracking down bookings, making the dream happen across borders.
- **Your strength through grief** — "Mom transitioned 12:32pm. She is at peace. Our family is too. The grief is not unending, we feel it through and through ✨" The way you held that moment with such grace taught me something about love.
- **"Hi girlies"** — those group messages that start with love and end with action.

You're a force, B. Thank you for letting me be part of what you're building. 🦋💕

## 💕 To Mommy

Dear Mom,

You've been in my Top 5 for three years straight, and honestly, you should be #1 in my heart forever. Our messages are a beautiful mix of the practical and the profound.

Thank you for:
- **The cream in travel sizes for Bali** — "I was going to surprise you, but would you like more cream in travel sizes for your trip to Bali!" You're always thinking of my comfort, even when I'm on the other side of the world.
- **Celebrating my wins** — "I saw in a story that you are now executive director! Congratulations!!! 👏👏👏🥰" Your pride in me is the fuel I run on.
- **The letter for Vanessa** — writing recommendations for my friends, caring about the people I care about. That letter was beautiful.
- **The bunny stories and Instagram comments** — "I loved your story about the bunny! I tried to comment, but it was not so easy. Will keep trying!" You're trying, and that means everything.
- **The reassurance when I need it most** — "I'm so sorry. This sounds like it was really hard. You are not a bad person. It was a lesson for all of you. I love you." Three sentences that heal.
- **Running a mile every day** — watching you tend to your own health and growth inspires me.
- **The Grand Budapest and the stained glass windows** — collaborating on Dad's art, the back-and-forth about what works. Family as creative partnership.

I love you so much. Thank you for being my soft place to land, always. 💕🌷

## 💜 To Melanie

Dear Mel,

Four out of five years in my Top 5 — you're a constant. Our friendship spans time zones and life chapters, and somehow we always find each other.

Thank you for:
- **The girlie advice sessions** — "Hey can I get some girlie advice" — you're my go-to for navigating the complicated stuff.
- **Medical wisdom mixed with care** — "I'm scarred after I told you you were fine and then you had pneumonia lol" — you care about my body even when I don't.
- **Musical Rounds and your research** — 100 patients, 81 loved ones, 42 hours of conversation and music. The work you're doing to bring music to people at the end of life is sacred.
- **The horses nuzzling you as you played** — "the horses literally like walked up to me and were like nuzzling me and stuff as i played" — of course they did. You have that energy.
- **The chaos of your schedule and the grace of your heart** — Newark to JFK to upstate NY to Redding to a wedding — you show up for everyone.
- **Saying it with love** — "And part of that is that you take the risk of not knowing how it will be received! But if you're doing it from a place of love then try to feel ok about that regardless of how she reacted." This is the advice I needed.
- **Colors, people, friendship, nature** — your four-word summary of what matters. Perfect.

You're finishing med school, creating podcasts of human connection, and still making time to check if I'm bruising more easily. That's friendship. 💜🎵

## 🌺 To Gabi

Dear Gabi,

You were my #1 for THREE YEARS (2021-2023). That's not just texting — that's a whole era of my life, a whole chapter of growth, woven together with yours.

Thank you for:
- **Holding space for all the feelings** — "but I've been doing so amazing this year at healing myself & feeling better than before- all these feelings coexisting w the pure gratitude and love I feel each day. Just doesn't take away from the heaviness on the days when I feel that too." You taught me that healing isn't linear.
- **The depth of our connection** — "and its this part of me that feels wholeheartedly, 'how dare i feel lonely with the depth of the connections that hold me'" — you get it.
- **Ceremonies with Cloe, adventures in the keys** — "ceremoniesssss with cloe centered for her bday" — the way we celebrate each other.
- **Your fearlessness** — circus training, competitive athletics, teaching yoga in Spanish every day. You throw yourself at life.
- **Being proud of me setting boundaries** — "i am proud of u for setting a boundary" — sometimes I need permission to protect my peace.
- **Crying about my future with Rob** — "especially the future things with rob! wow! omg crying" — you celebrate my love like it's your own.
- **The crunchy leaves** — "also the crunchy leaves are sooooo same" — the tiny joys we share.

You're in Miami now, living your beautiful life, and even though our message count shifted, the depth never did. Thank you for the Gabi Era. It shaped me. 🌺🦋
